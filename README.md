 The INSS - IT Supply Warehouse Project is an innovative initiative within the framework of my internship at the INSS (Instituto Nacional do Seguro Social), the Brazilian National Institute of Social Security. This project focuses on establishing an efficient and organized supply warehouse specifically tailored to the IT department's needs.
